# lunr-core
An attempt to port LUNR.js to .NET Core

![.NET Core](https://github.com/bleroy/lunr-core/workflows/.NET%20Core/badge.svg)

**Status**: early in the porting. All code has been ported, but not tested. The library is still unusable. Should be OK to start playing with before the end of July.
